# jnj-style-guide
This style guide is mostly based on the standards that are currently prevalent in JavaScript, although some conventions (i.e async/await or static class fields) may still be included or prohibited on a case-by-case basis.

  1. [Basic Rules](#basic-rules)
  2. [Naming](#naming)

## Basic Rules

  - Create each new component in folder (For example Table - Folder and inside index.tsx file)
  - Follow DRY (Don’t repeat yourself), KISS (Keep it small and simple), DIE (Duplication Is Evil), YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It), SOLID principles

## Naming

  - **Extensions**: Use `.tsx` extension for React components with typescript.
  - **Filename**: Use PascalCase for filenames. E.g., `ReservationCard.tsx`.
  - **Reference Naming**: Use PascalCase for React components and camelCase for their instances.
